To address the intermittent data loss, I implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff. This ensures that write operations are retried multiple times with increasing delays if they fail initially. The error handling is also improved to log any potential issues.  Here's how the code was modified:

```java
// FirebasePersistenceSolution.java

public void writeDataWithRetry(String key, Object value) {
    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
    db.collection("myCollection").document(key).set(value)
        .addOnSuccessListener(aVoid -> {
            Log.d(TAG, "Data written successfully!");
        })
        .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
            Log.w(TAG, "Error writing document", e);
            retryWrite(key, value, 1); // Start retrying
        });
}

private void retryWrite(String key, Object value, int retryCount) {
    if (retryCount > MAX_RETRIES) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Failed to write data after multiple retries.");
        return;
    }
    long delay = (long) (Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
    Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());
    handler.postDelayed(() -> writeDataWithRetry(key, value), delay);
}

private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
```
